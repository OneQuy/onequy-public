COMMIT TO MY-SELF
13 Jun 2025

https://x.com/onequy/status/1933383322329284719

From now on I commit myself only double down on 3 apps:

1. ClockVibes: an aesthetic clock (90% done, waiting AppStore review)
2. LifeStat: log events in life (in develop)
3. OnRepeat: a no. 1 music insight app (trying to kick off late this year) 

No more ideas. No more apps!
