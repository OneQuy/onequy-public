COMMIT TO MY-SELF
13 Jun 2025

From now on I commit myself only double down on 3 apps:

1. ClockVibes: an aesthetic clock (90% done, waiting AppStore review)
2. LifeStat: log events in life (in develop)
3. OnRepeat: a no. 1 music insight app (trying to kick off late this year) 

No more ideas. No more apps!

I really admire those who build and market their product for a long time, for years. I want to become one of them. I'm committed and will pour my whole heart into these three apps.

- ClockVibes: I see big potential with it. Lot of people using similar apps while they studying or working.
- LifeStat: Solving my own problem! Build it so the ones like me can use it as well.
- OnRepeat: I love music. Music saves my life, I wanna do something to give back to it.
